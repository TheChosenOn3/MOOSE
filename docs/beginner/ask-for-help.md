# How to ask for help
{: .no_toc }

1. Table of contents
{:toc}

After you have tried to solve the problem on your own, you can also get help
from the community.

{: .highlight }
> But it is important to follow certain rules! Read them below.

## Communities

There are two ways to communicate with the community.
The fastest way is to use Discord:

- <https://discord.gg/gj68fm969S>{:target="_blank"}

But if you don't like Discord, you are able to post in the DCS forum.
Check out the MOOSE thread here:

## How to post requests

MOOSE is a community project and support is community based.

Please remember when posting a question:

- Before posting anything follow the [troubleshooting steps].
- **Read your logs**.

A post should contain the following:

1. A describtion what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
    - Do not use vague words this stuff is hard to help with! Be specific.

2. Describe what happens instead.
    - The less detail you offer, the less chance you can be helped.
    - Don’t say it doesn’t work. Or is it broken. Say what it actually does.

3. Post your code in Discord as formatted code:

  - Wrap a single line of code in backticks \` like this:

    ![discord-single-line-code.png](../images/beginner/discord-single-line-code.png)

  - Multiple lines of code should be posted like this:

    ![discord-multi-line-code.png](../images/beginner/discord-multi-line-code.png)

- Post your log lines with the error or warning messages. Format them like this:

    ![discord-fomat-logs.png](../images/beginner/discord-fomat-logs.png)

- Some complex problems need the mission (.miz file) also.

  - But post your mission only when requested.
  - Try to simplify your mission if it is complex!

There are people in the Discord and in the forum, who spend their free time to
help you. <br />
It is your responsibility to make their "work" as easy as possible.

Welcome to MOOSE and good luck!
